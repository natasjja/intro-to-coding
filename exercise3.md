# Exercise 3

This is a bonus exercise for if you manage to finish your webpage or to try at home by yourself!

At the moment, your webpage is only available locally, on your computer. We're going to make it so your webpage
can be viewed on the internet!

We're going to use a web hosting service called Netlify. A web host is a business that provides a service needed
for your webpage to be viewed on the internet. 


### Steps

> NB: Netlify is a FREE service and so you won't be charged

1.  Go to https://www.netlify.com/

    * Click Sign up in the top righthand corner
    * Select Email
    * Enter your email and a password to use for this site
    * Verify your account by checking your email

2.  On your OS (Mac Finder / Windows Explorer)

    * Find the boilerplate folder we've been working in, on your computer.

3.  On Netlify (once signed in)

    * Drag the boilerplate folder into Netlify where it says "Drag a folder with a static site here".
    * Netlify will then give you a generated link with a random generated name e.g.
        `https://youthful-ardinghelli-fe460d.netlify.com`
      This is your webpage!
    * Go to the link and see your webpage now online! Don't forget to share with your family and friends!
